# MERN Book Collection

## Description

This was a good test for me to try to swap out a restful api with graphql to help me better learn how the calls of graphql work. I had to make the resolvers and typedefs on the server side as well as the mutations and queries on the client side. The hardest part by far was implimenting the changes on the pages in the client side using the hooks. As of right now the search page is much cliener than the saved books page but they both work as of right now. I hope to later rewrite the savedpage side to be cleaner and use hooks more effectively in the future

## Usage

This application is so the user can search books based on a key word(s) to find books the user would like to read. The user can then save the book or books the would like to read to their profile if they have signed up. After they have saved all the books they would like to read they can view them in the saved books page. after the user has read a book they can take it off their list by deleting the book from their saved books page.
